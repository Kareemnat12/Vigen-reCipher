## Introduction

The Vigenère cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution. This program takes an input string and a key, then encodes the string based on the key while preserving spaces and non-alphabet characters.

## Getting Started

To compile and run the program, ensure you have a C compiler installed (like `gcc`).

### Prerequisites

- C compiler (e.g., `gcc`)
- Basic understanding of C programming and the Vigenère cipher

## Files

- `main.c`: The main source file containing the implementation of the Vigenère cipher encoding.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kareemnat12/Vigen-reCipher.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd DigitalDesignVHDL
   ```

3. Compile the program:

   ```bash
   gcc main.c -o vigenere
   ```

4. Run the program:

   ```bash
   ./vigenere
   ```

5. Follow the prompts to input the plaintext string and the keyword for encoding.
